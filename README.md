# DestinySharp [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w7ig7d6dw8yl7yoq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Fires1/destinysharp)
DestinySharp's goal is to introduce a completely object oriented approach for the Bungie API.

For light weight applications, this may not be the project you're looking for.

# DESTINY 2 PLAN

Okay! We've finally heard about the D2 api.

D2 documentation will be live August 23. Giving us at this current time 3 weeks to finish up before we have a ton more ship to do.

Heres what I propose:

Finish Models
Attempt to Finish Endpoints
Stop all work on D1 api and prepare methods for D2 endpoints
Test D2 endpoints like hell
